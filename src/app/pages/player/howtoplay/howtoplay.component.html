<p>⚽ A foul maybe called but if deemed not too aggressive but a little reckless by the referee, then no card will be awarded only a verbal warning.</p>
<p>⚽ In an event of any foul a <u>freekick</u> is awarded to the opposing team. A <u>freekick</u> is where a single player chosen from the awarded team, places the ball where the foul is committed and kicks the ball back into play, or into the goal.</p>
<p>⚽ If a foul was called on the defending team in their own 18 yard box, then a <u>penalty</u> kick is awarded to the opposing team. In a penalty kick a single player chosen from the awarded team, places the ball on the penalty spot, and  gets to have a shot one on one versus the goalkeeper. All of the other players are to be on the edge of the 18 yard box, and the penalty arc, where they may not interfere with the play, until it has been kicked/touched by the player taking the shot.</p>

<p>⚽ In an event of a <u>goal kick</u> the opposing goalkeeper, of the attacking team, places the ball on the six yard box(gaolkeeper's box) and restarts the play from there with a kick. In an event of a <u>corner kick</u>, the opposing team of the defending teams, chooses a single player to kick the ball back into play from the corner flag. The designated corner flag is determined by the direction of the ball from where it went out of play.</p>
<p>⚽ An <u>offsides</u> call is called when an attacking team attempts to play a ball to one of its players that is behind the last defender of the defending team. If the ball left the foot of the passer while the other teammate is behind the last defender of the defending side, then it is called.
